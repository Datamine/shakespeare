# shakespeare
LLM shakespeare tutor in the browser

### what is this?
1. i always wanted an epub reading companion where i could use an LLM to interrogate the text live
2. easiest to start with shakespeare, known formats, and a pick-a-play format, rather than an upload-your-own

### TODO
- return shakespeare head to original position during rotation


### Text Sources
All the Shakespeare plays in `src/texts` are from https://github.com/cobanov/shakespeare-dataset. That repository itself appears to be sourced from the Folger Shakespeare Library.
