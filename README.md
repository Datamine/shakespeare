# Shakespeare
The [https://shakespeare.pizza](https://shakespeare.pizza) AI Shakespeare Tutor in the Browser

### Current Version
<!-- VERSION -->1.0.1<!-- /VERSION -->

### what is this?
1. i always wanted an epub reading companion where i could use an LLM to interrogate the text live
2. easiest to start with shakespeare, known formats, and a pick-a-play format, rather than an upload-your-own

### TODO
- return shakespeare head to original position during rotation
- Go through all the character files and fix the formatting.. what we have is not ideal
- make line breaks more clear, indent slightly when a line is broken

### Characters
The text sources are not quite satisfactory, pulled the formatting from Folger sites like https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/coriolanus/read/characterList/

### Text Sources
All the Shakespeare plays in `plays/` are from https://github.com/cobanov/shakespeare-dataset. That repository itself appears to be sourced from the Folger Shakespeare Library.
