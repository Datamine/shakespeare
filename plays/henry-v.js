<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="2">My lord, I&rsquo;ll tell you that self bill is urged</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="3">Which in th&rsquo; eleventh year of the last king&rsquo;s reign</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="4">Was like, and had indeed against us passed</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="5">But that the scambling and unquiet time</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="6">Did push it out of farther question.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="7">But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="8">It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="9">We lose the better half of our possession,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="10">For all the temporal lands which men devout</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="11">By testament have given to the Church</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="12">Would they strip from us, being valued thus:</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="13">&ldquo;As much as would maintain, to the King&rsquo;s honor,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="14">Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="15">Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="16">And, to relief of lazars and weak age</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="17">Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="18">A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="19">And to the coffers of the King besides,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="20">A thousand pounds by th&rsquo; year.&rdquo; Thus runs the bill.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="21">This would drink deep.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="22">&rsquo;Twould drink the cup and</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="23">all.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="24">But what prevention?</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="25">The King is full of grace and fair regard.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="26">And a true lover of the holy Church.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="27">The courses of his youth promised it not.</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="28">The breath no sooner left his father&rsquo;s body</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="29">But that his wildness, mortified in him,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="30">Seemed to die too. Yea, at that very moment</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="31">Consideration like an angel came</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="32">And whipped th&rsquo; offending Adam out of him,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="33">Leaving his body as a paradise</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="34">T&rsquo; envelop and contain celestial spirits.</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="35">Never was such a sudden scholar made,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="36">Never came reformation in a flood</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="37">With such a heady currance scouring faults,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="38">Nor never Hydra-headed willfulness</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="39">So soon did lose his seat, and all at once,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="40">As in this king.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="41">We are blessed in the change.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="42">Hear him but reason in divinity</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="43">And, all-admiring, with an inward wish</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="44">You would desire the King were made a prelate;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="45">Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="46">You would say it hath been all in all his study;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="47">List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="48">A fearful battle rendered you in music;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="49">Turn him to any cause of policy,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="50">The Gordian knot of it he will unloose</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="51">Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="52">The air, a chartered libertine, is still,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="53">And the mute wonder lurketh in men&rsquo;s ears</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="54">To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="55">So that the art and practic part of life</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="56">Must be the mistress to this theoric;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="57">Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="58">Since his addiction was to courses vain,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="59">His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="60">His hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="61">And never noted in him any study,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="62">Any retirement, any sequestration</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="63">From open haunts and popularity.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="64">The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="65">And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="66">Neighbored by fruit of baser quality;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="67">And so the Prince obscured his contemplation</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="68">Under the veil of wildness, which, no doubt,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="69">Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="70">Unseen yet crescive in his faculty.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="71">It must be so, for miracles are ceased,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="72">And therefore we must needs admit the means</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="73">How things are perfected.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="74">But, my good lord,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="75">How now for mitigation of this bill</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="76">Urged by the Commons? Doth his Majesty</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="77">Incline to it or no?</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="78">He seems indifferent,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="79">Or rather swaying more upon our part</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="80">Than cherishing th&rsquo; exhibitors against us;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="81">For I have made an offer to his Majesty&mdash;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="82">Upon our spiritual convocation</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="83">And in regard of causes now in hand,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="84">Which I have opened to his Grace at large,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="85">As touching France&mdash;to give a greater sum</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="86">Than ever at one time the clergy yet</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="87">Did to his predecessors part withal.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="88">How did this offer seem received, my lord?</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="89">With good acceptance of his Majesty&mdash;</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="90">Save that there was not time enough to hear,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="91">As I perceived his Grace would fain have done,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="92">The severals and unhidden passages</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="93">Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="94">And generally to the crown and seat of France,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="95">Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="96">What was th&rsquo; impediment that broke this off?</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="97">The French ambassador upon that instant</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="98">Craved audience. And the hour, I think, is come</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="99">To give him hearing. Is it four o&rsquo;clock?</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="100">It is.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="101">Then go we in to know his embassy,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="102">Which I could with a ready guess declare</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="103">Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</div>
<br>
<speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="104">I&rsquo;ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.</div>

<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="41">Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="42">That owe yourselves, your lives, and services</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="43">To this imperial throne. There is no bar</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="44">To make against your Highness&rsquo; claim to France</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="45">But this, which they produce from Pharamond:</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="46">&ldquo;In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="47">(No woman shall succeed in Salic land),</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="48">Which Salic land the French unjustly gloze</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="49">To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="50">The founder of this law and female bar.</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="51">Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="52">That the land Salic is in Germany,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="53">Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="54">Where Charles the Great, having subdued the</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="55">Saxons,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="56">There left behind and settled certain French,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="57">Who, holding in disdain the German women</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="58">For some dishonest manners of their life,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="59">Established then this law: to wit, no female</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="60">Should be inheritrix in Salic land,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="61">Which &ldquo;Salic,&rdquo; as I said, &rsquo;twixt Elbe and Sala</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="62">Is at this day in Germany called Meissen.</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="63">Then doth it well appear the Salic law</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="64">Was not devised for the realm of France,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="65">Nor did the French possess the Salic land</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="66">Until four hundred one and twenty years</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="67">After defunction of King Pharamond,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="68">Idly supposed the founder of this law,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="69">Who died within the year of our redemption</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="70">Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="71">Subdued the Saxons and did seat the French</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="72">Beyond the river Sala in the year</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="73">Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="74">King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="75">Did, as heir general, being descended</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="76">Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="77">Make claim and title to the crown of France.</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="78">Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="79">Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="80">Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="81">To find his title with some shows of truth,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="82">Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="83">Conveyed himself as th&rsquo; heir to th&rsquo; Lady Lingare,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="84">Daughter to Charlemagne, who was the son</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="85">To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="86">Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="87">Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="88">Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="89">Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="90">That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="91">Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="92">Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine:</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="93">By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="94">Was reunited to the crown of France.</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="95">So that, as clear as is the summer&rsquo;s sun,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="96">King Pepin&rsquo;s title and Hugh Capet&rsquo;s claim,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="97">King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="98">To hold in right and title of the female.</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="99">So do the kings of France unto this day,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="100">Howbeit they would hold up this Salic law</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="101">To bar your Highness claiming from the female,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="102">And rather choose to hide them in a net</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="103">Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="104">Usurped from you and your progenitors.</div>
<br>

<speaker>BISHOP OF CANTERBURY</speaker>

<div class="play-line" data-line-number="180">some, making the wars their bulwark, that have</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="181">before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage</div>

<div class="play-line" data-line-number="185">War is His beadle, war is His vengeance, so that here</div>

<div class="play-line" data-line-number="187">laws in now the King&rsquo;s quarrel. Where they feared</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="188">the death, they have borne life away; and where they</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="189">would be safe, they perish. Then, if they die unprovided,</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="190">no more is the King guilty of their damnation</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="191">than he was before guilty of those impieties for the</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="192">which they are now visited. Every subject&rsquo;s duty is</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="193">the King&rsquo;s, but every subject&rsquo;s soul is his own.</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="194">Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="195">every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of</div>
<div class="play-line" data-line-number="196">his conscience. And, dying so, death is to him</div>
